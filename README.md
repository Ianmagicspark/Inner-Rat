# Inner-Rat
A RAT(remote access tool) made in python.

# IMPORTANT!!!
I will not be held responsible for any bad stuff done with this.

# How to use
In both client.py and server.py, set HOST to the server you're using and PORT to the port you want to use.
client.py needs to be turned on first, then server.py

Type any command into client.py's interface and the command will run on server.py's system.
If you type a non-existant command, the interface will freeze.
Commands that have a lot of data transfered will not work the way they are intend(still working on that)
